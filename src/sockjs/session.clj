;; JSON Unicode Encoding
;; =====================
;;
;; SockJS takes the responsibility of encoding Unicode strings for
;; the user. The idea is that SockJS should properly deliver any
;; valid string from the browser to the server and back. This is
;; actually quite hard, as browsers do some magical character
;; translations. Additionally there are some valid characters from
;; JavaScript point of view that are not valid Unicode, called
;; surrogates (JavaScript uses UCS-2, which is not really Unicode).
;;
;; Dealing with unicode surrogates (0xD800-0xDFFF) is quite special.
;; If possible we should make sure that server does escape decode
;; them. This makes sense for SockJS servers that support UCS-2
;; (SockJS-node), but can't really work for servers supporting unicode
;; properly (Python).
;;
;; The server can't send Unicode surrogates over Websockets, also various
;; \u2xxxx chars get mangled. Additionally, if the server is capable of
;; handling UCS-2 (ie: 16 bit character size), it should be able to deal
;; with Unicode surrogates 0xD800-0xDFFF:
